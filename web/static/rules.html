    <h3>How the game works</h3>
    <p>
        You enter the game as soon as you have a working gun. First, build your gun from the given parts. Then, fire it at the base station to test communication and initialize it. Once that succeeds, you are in the game. The game does not have a definite "end."
    </p>
    <p>
        Scream into the back of your laser gun to fire it. You will know your gun is firing because the green LED will light. It will also make a "pew pew" noise, but you can't hear it over your screaming. You can't be hit while you are firing.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you get shot, your gun's red LED will light, and it will play a sad song. As long as the red LED is lit, you cannot fire. The red LED will blink rapidly when you are about to respawn.
    </p>
    <p>
        You start with 10 health. Every time you get hit, you lose one health. When your health reaches zero, your gun will deactivate. While dead, the gun will beep occasionally and the red LED will pulse. To revive, point and hold your dead gun at the base station.
    <p>
        You can shoot the base station at any time to restore your gun to full health. It will also sync your hits to the website. Keep pointing your gun at the base station until it makes a happy noise.
    </p>
    <h3>Social Rules</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't cover your IR sensor.</li>
        <li>Don't shoot near the base station unless you are trying to communicate with it.</li>
        <li>Leave your gun powered on. The batteries will last plenty long.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If you see anyone breaking the social rules, we suggest applying the butt of your gun to their facial region until they comply.
